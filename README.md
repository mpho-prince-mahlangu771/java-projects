# About The Project
A simple text-based java application that allows simulates a ficticious bank, which I've arbitrarily named Fake Bank Merchants. The application will allow users to create a fake-bank account and perform typical banking operations such as depositing , withdrawing and , transferring, and also allow them to  view and edit  their banking profile.

## What I learnt From This Project 
 I could have used a web or java swing GUI, which could have simplified the entire development process but I intentionally chose not to. I believe a text-based-interface allowed me to greatly improve my problem-solving and logical skills. It made me to  become more creative as I faced issues such as dealing with bad input,issues with connecting to a datasource, beautifully formatting output, etc. 


## What next
My goal is to become a high value back-end Java software engineer. I'm working to master as much basic java before moving on to the ultimate boss -  spring boot. I will be moving  from only text-based interfaces to GUI as soon as possible, I already have a front-end skill set.
